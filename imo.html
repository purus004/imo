        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>Commercial floriculture is the practice of cultivating flowers on a large scale for sale and export. This sector is crucial for the agricultural economy as it provides employment and supports the global flower trade. The integrated development of commercial floriculture involves a holistic approach that integrates sustainable agricultural practices, pest control, disease management, and the efficient use of fertilizers to maximize production while minimizing environmental impact.</p>

        <h2>Common Flower Diseases</h2>
        <div class="disease-text">
            <p>Flower diseases can cause serious damage to plants, affecting both their growth and aesthetic value. Common diseases in commercial floriculture include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that appears as white, powdery spots on leaves and flowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Botrytis Blight:</strong> A fungal infection causing wilting and grey mold on flowers, especially in humid environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A disease that leads to yellowing of leaves and mold growth, commonly occurring in wet conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Fertilizers for Healthy Flower Growth</h2>
        <div class="fertilizer-text">
            <p>Fertilizers provide essential nutrients to plants, promoting strong growth and vibrant flowers. The main types of fertilizers used in floriculture are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Derived from natural sources, such as compost, manure, and seaweed extract, these fertilizers improve soil quality and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> These are synthetic fertilizers that provide essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) to boost flower production.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow-Release Fertilizers:</strong> These fertilizers release nutrients over an extended period, reducing the risk of over-fertilization and ensuring plants get a steady supply of nutrients.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="gallery">

        <h2>Pest Management in Floriculture</h2>
        <div class="pest-text">
            <p>Pests can cause significant damage to flowers, leading to reduced yields and poor quality. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, and chemical control methods. Common pests in floriculture include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small, green or black insects that feed on plant sap, stunting growth and spreading diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Spider Mites:</strong> Tiny arachnids that cause leaf discoloration and webbing on plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Thrips:</strong> Small insects that cause scarring on flowers and leaves by feeding on plant tissue.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
